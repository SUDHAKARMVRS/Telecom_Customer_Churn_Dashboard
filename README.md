# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis Project

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Customer Churn Analysis** using the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**. The goal is to identify patterns and key factors that influence customer churn and to present insights through **data analysis, machine learning, and Power BI dashboards**.

The project includes:

* Data exploration and preprocessing using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**
* Predictive modeling for churn classification
* Interactive data visualization using **Power BI**

## 📄 Dataset Description

**File:** `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`

The dataset contains customer information including:

* Demographics (gender, senior citizen, partner, dependents)
* Account information (tenure, contract type, payment method)
* Services used (internet service, streaming, tech support)
* Charges (monthly charges, total charges)
* Target variable: **Churn** (Yes / No)

---

## 🧪 Jupyter Notebook (`tele.ipynb`)

The notebook includes:

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Encoding categorical variables
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Feature selection
6. Model building (Logistic Regression / ML models)
7. Model evaluation and insights

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard (`Customer Churn.pbix`)

The Power BI report provides:

* Overall churn rate
* Churn by contract type
* Churn by payment method
* Monthly charges vs churn
* Customer segmentation insights

The dashboard helps stakeholders quickly understand **why customers leave** and which groups are at higher risk.
